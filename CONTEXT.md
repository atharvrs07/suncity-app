# My Suncity Vistaar — Project Context

Residential society management web app. Node.js/Express/SQLite backend + React/Vite frontend,
JWT auth (phone + password), mobile-first responsive web (no native app).

## Build status (updated 2026-07-19)

All four phases from the spec are **built and smoke-tested**:

1. ✅ DB schema for all 4 roles + auth + approval chain (incl. admin signup + fallback seed admin)
2. ✅ Hamburger drawer nav shell + iOS 26 "Liquid Glass" design system (Inter, frosted glass, Framer Motion)
3. ✅ Core modules: complaints (supervisor category scoping), dues + UPI QR + UTR verification,
   notices (incl. admin-only), automated dues engine (node-cron + Run Now), extension requests
   (5-day cap enforced server-side), Overdue Watch (admin, tel: CTA + mark paid)
4. ✅ New modules: classifieds (admin/OB only), lost & found, society events, photo gallery

Deferred by design (do not build): AI chatbot, AI summaries, push notifications, trending news,
real payment gateway.

## Running it

```
npm install && npm --prefix client install   # once
npm run build                                # builds client/dist
npm start                                    # serves API + SPA on PORT (default 4000)
```

Dev mode with hot reload: `npm run dev` (server) + `npm run dev:client` (Vite on 5173, proxies /api and /uploads to 4000).

`.env` holds JWT_SECRET, PORT, SOCIETY_UPI_VPA, SOCIETY_UPI_PAYEE_NAME, ADMIN_SEED_*, plus
GMAIL_USER / GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD (password-reset emails; blank app password → links logged to
console) and optional APP_BASE_URL for emailed links (see .env.example).
SQLite DB + uploads live in `data/` (override with DATA_DIR for persistent hosting).

### Local dev accounts (created during smoke tests)

- Admin (seeded): phone `9999999999` / `admin123`
- Resident: `9000000001` / `test123` (Ravi Resident, A-101)
- Cleaning Supervisor: `9000000002` / `test123`

## Architecture

```
server/
  index.js         Express app; mounts routes; serves client/dist + /uploads; error handler
  config.js        env + role/category constants (single source of truth for RBAC lists)
  db.js            better-sqlite3 schema (CREATE IF NOT EXISTS) + ensureSeedAdmin()
  cron.js          daily 01:10 job: overdue sweep + automation runner (also runs at boot; idempotent)
  middleware/auth.js  sign / authRequired (re-checks status=approved per request) / requireRoles
  lib/uploads.js   multer disk storage → DATA_DIR/uploads, images only, 5 MB cap
  lib/dates.js     localDateStr / addDays (local-time date strings, YYYY-MM-DD)
  lib/passwords.js genPassword() — shared secure random password generator
  lib/mailer.js    nodemailer Gmail SMTP (app password); console fallback when unconfigured
  routes/          auth, approvals, users, complaints, notices, dues (incl. payments +
                   overdue-watch), extensions, automations, classifieds, lostfound, events, gallery
client/src/
  api.js           fetch wrapper (JWT header, 401 → logout), fmtMoney/fmtDate helpers
  auth.jsx         AuthProvider context (login/logout/me)
  constants.js     categories w/ emoji, statuses w/ chip tones, MENU with role visibility
  hooks.js         useFetch(path) with reload()
  components/
    Layout.jsx     topbar + hamburger + Liquid Glass drawer (framer-motion spring) + page transitions
    Glass.jsx      GlassCard/Btn/Chip/Field/Toggle/Segmented/Sheet(bottom sheet)/Empty/Stagger*
  pages/           Login, Signup, ForgotPassword, ResetPassword, Home, Complaints, Dues,
                   Notices, Classifieds, Approvals, Admin, LostFound, Events, Gallery, Settings
```

## Office-bearer login (added 2026-07-20)

Office bearers sign in with **username + password** at the hidden route **`/ob/login`**
(POST `/api/auth/ob-login`) — intentionally NOT linked from any page, menu, or the main
login screen; reachable only by typing the URL. Same JWT as everyone else, so all existing
RBAC middleware applies unchanged. Phone login for admin/resident/supervisor is untouched.

- Schema: `users.phone` is now nullable, `users.username` added (both UNIQUE, nullable).
  Migration for pre-existing DBs is a users-table rebuild in `db.js` (`migrateUsersUsername`),
  idempotent, verified with `PRAGMA foreign_key_check`.
- Seed: `node server/seed-office-bearers.js` — one-time seed of the 12 title accounts
  (usernames are lowercase slugs: `chairman`, `vice-chairman-1`, … `member-6`), each with a
  distinct random 12-char password, bcrypt-hashed, status `approved`. Credentials are printed
  once and appended to `office-bearer-credentials.txt` (git-ignored). Re-running skips
  existing usernames.
- Security: single generic "Invalid username or password" for every failure (no username
  enumeration), dummy bcrypt compare for unknown usernames (timing), in-memory rate limit
  (10 attempts / 15 min / IP → 429; resets on server restart).
- Follow-ups (not built): force password change on first OB login (OBs can already change
  passwords voluntarily in Settings); admin UI to create/reset office-bearer accounts.

## Password reset & recovery (added 2026-07-20)

- **Admin reset**: `POST /api/users/:id/reset-password` (admin-only via the router-level guard)
  generates a fresh 12-char password (shared `lib/passwords.js` generator, same one the OB seed
  uses), returns it exactly once, and logs an `[audit] Admin X reset the password of Y` line.
  Works on any account incl. other admins and self. UI: 🔑 Reset Password on each card in
  Admin → Users; the new password shows in a bottom sheet with a copy button.
- **Self-service forgot password**: users.email added (nullable UNIQUE, `migrateUsersEmail`
  ALTER + partial unique index; captured optionally at signup and editable in Settings).
  `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` (5 req / 15 min / IP) always answers the same generic
  message; for an approved account with that email it stores a SHA-256-hashed single-use token
  in `password_reset_tokens` (30-min expiry, previous unused tokens invalidated) and emails
  `APP_BASE_URL/reset-password?token=…`. `POST /api/auth/reset-password` validates hash +
  expiry + single-use inside a transaction. Admin reset also wipes outstanding tokens.
- **Email**: nodemailer via Gmail SMTP from suncityvistaar2000@gmail.com using a Google App
  Password (GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD in .env — NOT the account password). With it blank (local dev),
  `lib/mailer.js` logs the full mail incl. reset link to the console so the loop stays testable.
- **Show/hide password**: `PasswordInput` in Glass.jsx (eye toggle, `.pwd-wrap`/`.pwd-eye` CSS)
  used on Login, OB Login, Signup, Settings (both fields), and Reset Password.
- Smoke-tested 2026-07-20: 26/26 checks — admin reset for resident/OB/self (+403 for
  non-admin), forgot→email-link→reset→login loop, token single-use/expiry/bogus rejection,
  email uniqueness (409), generic-message parity for unknown emails. Dev passwords restored.

## Resident signup via email OTP (added 2026-07-20)

Public signup at `/signup` is now **residents only** — the role/account-type dropdown is
gone. Instead of parking accounts in `pending` for admin approval, residents verify an
emailed OTP and are created already `approved` + logged in. Other roles are still
provisioned outside this flow (office bearers via `seed-office-bearers.js` + hidden `/ob/login`;
admins via the env seed / `ensureSeedAdmin`) — that path is untouched, and the Approvals
screen + approval chain remain for it.

- **Flow**: `POST /api/auth/signup` (name, phone, email, flat_no, password — email now
  required) validates + checks phone/email uniqueness, then stashes the details (password
  bcrypt-hashed) and a SHA-256-hashed 6-digit code in the new `signup_otps` table (10-min
  expiry) and emails the code. **No user row is created yet.** `POST /api/auth/verify-signup`
  (email + otp) checks the code, creates the approved resident inside a transaction (re-guards
  uniqueness), consumes the OTP row, notifies admins, and returns `{ token, user }` — the
  client logs straight in. `POST /api/auth/resend-otp` regenerates the code.
- **Abuse controls**: per-record 10-min expiry, max 5 wrong attempts (then burned), max 5
  resends, 60-second resend cooldown; plus in-memory per-IP limiters on signup (10/15min),
  verify (20/15min), resend (10/15min). Resend gives a generic reply for unknown/completed
  emails (no enumeration).
- **Admin notification**: no in-app notification system exists, so each approved admin with an
  email on file is emailed (name + email + phone + flat) when a resident joins
  (`sendNewResidentAdminEmail`). Admins without an email are skipped (logged).
- **Email**: `lib/mailer.js` gained `sendSignupOtpEmail` (code prominently shown, expiry note)
  and `sendNewResidentAdminEmail`, reusing the existing Gmail-SMTP transport / console fallback.
- **Frontend**: `Signup.jsx` is a two-step form (details → OTP entry with resend + live
  cooldown timer); `auth.jsx` gained `completeSignup(token, user)` to adopt the returned
  session. `.otp-input` style added.
- Smoke-tested 2026-07-20: 21/21 — full loop (signup→console OTP→verify→approved resident+JWT→
  phone login works→admin emailed), wrong-code attempts-left, resend cooldown 429, expired-code
  rejection+cleanup, replay/duplicate-email/short-password/missing-email rejection, generic
  resend for unknown email.

## Key invariants (enforce on any change)

- **RBAC lives on the API**, not just the UI. Roles: admin, office_bearer (12 named slots),
  supervisor (maintenance | cleaning), resident.
  - Classifieds: admin + office_bearer ONLY (residents/supervisors get 403 and no menu item).
  - Approvals + Admin + user management + automations + payment verification: admin only.
  - Cleaning supervisor sees ONLY `park_cleaning`, `drainage_cleaning`, `road_garbage_pickup`
    complaints; maintenance supervisor sees everything EXCEPT those (see CLEANING_CATEGORIES
    in server/config.js).
- **Approval chain**: applies to every path EXCEPT resident signup — those now self-activate via
  email OTP (see the OTP section above) and are created `approved`. Any other pending account
  (created outside the public signup) still starts `pending` and cannot log in until an admin
  approves; self-approval is blocked; `ensureSeedAdmin()` promotes/creates the env-seeded admin
  whenever zero approved admins exist, so the chain can never dead-lock. Approvals screen shows
  filled office-bearer/supervisor slots (informational, not hard-capped).
- **Dues**: UPI QR is client-generated (`upi://pay?pa=&pn=&am=&tr=DUE{id}&cu=INR` via qrcode pkg);
  resident submits UTR → admin verifies/rejects. Automation dedupe via partial unique index on
  (automation_id, user_id, period_key). Extensions max 5 days total per due, summed over
  pending+approved requests, enforced server-side; approval pushes dues.due_date.
- Notices with `admin_only=1` are visible to admins only; only admins can set the flag.

## Nice-to-have next steps (not started)

- Office-bearer permission depth refinement (spec allows refining later)
- Complaint comments/updates thread; notice editing
- Pagination for large lists (dues admin list currently caps at 500)
- PWA manifest + installability polish
